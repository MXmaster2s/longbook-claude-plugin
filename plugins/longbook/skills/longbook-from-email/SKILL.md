# longbook: From your email

longbook is the user's financial memory: every commitment they pay, its charges past and
planned, their accounts and the people payments are for. Finds subscriptions, expenses,
invoices, insurances, purchases, bills, loans and EMIs, travel bookings or money in in the
user's email, and adds them to their longbook. Each prompt below has a procedure on the
longbook server; follow it rather than improvising one.

## How to run one

1. Pick the prompt below that matches what the user asked, in our words or theirs.
2. Call the longbook connector's `read_guide` with the prompt's name, for example
   `read_guide("find-subscriptions-from-my-email")`. It returns the procedure, step by step, and the guide
   chapter it builds on.
3. Follow that procedure and the guide's rules. Never write a card number, a full account
   number, a PIN or a password.
4. If no longbook tools are available, say the longbook connector is needed: in Claude,
   Settings, then Connectors, then Add custom connector, with the address
   https://longbook.app/mcp, signing in with the longbook account. Installing this plugin adds the
   connector too.
