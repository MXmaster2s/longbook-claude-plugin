# longbook: Reports

longbook is the user's financial memory: every commitment they pay, its charges past and
planned, their accounts and the people payments are for. Asks longbook to draw a report over
the days, accounts, people or categories the user chooses, or for a trip. Each prompt below has
a procedure on the longbook server; follow it rather than improvising one.

## How to run one

1. Pick the prompt below that matches what the user asked, in our words or theirs.
2. Call the longbook connector's `read_guide` with the prompt's name, for example
   `read_guide("create-a-report-in-my-longbook")`. It returns the procedure, step by step, and the guide
   chapter it builds on.
3. Follow that procedure and the guide's rules. Never write a card number, a full account
   number, a PIN or a password.
4. If no longbook tools are available, say the longbook connector is needed: in Claude,
   Settings, then Connectors, then Add custom connector, with the address
   https://longbook.app/mcp, signing in with the longbook account. Installing this plugin adds the
   connector too.
